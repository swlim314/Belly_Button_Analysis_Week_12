# Bellybutton Diversity Analysis
The goal of this analysis was to create an interactive dashboard based off of sample information that was provided to us. Different chart types were requested based on the
type of data being shown, including a bar chart to show the top 10 cultures found for that person, a bubble chart that showed bacteria cultures per sample, and a gauge chart
that showed bellybutton washing frequency. After this dashboard was developed, I made several changes to the layout of the site, changing the background color, title text family
type, and the paragraph header color.

Attached below is an image of the local host deployment of the interactive dashboard:
